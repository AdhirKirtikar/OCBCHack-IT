# OCBCHack-IT
Assignment for OCBCHack-IT - Data &amp; AI Track

# Scope of Assignment
● Use the US Traffic 2015 Dataset, publicly available on Kaggle, to visualise the traffic patterns.

● This assignment aims to clean and analyse the dataset, create appropriate models and visualise them using the proper software.

# Functionality
● Use the appropriate algorithms and models to find out the top 5 most obvious patterns from this data.

● Support your hypotheses with appropriate data.

# Requirements
● Submit a Jupyter Notebook with the data models.

● Good commenting and Documentation is essential.

● Explain why you chose this particular model for solving the problem.

● Create a new Git repo where you will upload the relevant project files.

# Implementation
● The analysis and models are available in the "US Traffic 2015 Analysis.ipynb" Jupyter notebook.

● Clone the repository in your local folder and install dependencies numpy, pandas, matplotlib & statsmodels.tsa.seasonal.

● Run the cell for import of all the required modules first.

● Download the "dot_traffic_2015.txt" & "dot_traffic_stations_2015.txt" files from https://www.kaggle.com/jboysen/us-traffic-2015.

● Run the read csv cells to import the data into pandas dataframe.

● Go through each cell of the notebook serially as some dataframes are created in upper cells and referenced in lower cells.
